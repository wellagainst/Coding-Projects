# Coding-Projects
This repository archives my course assignments and intern project that involves coding in Python. 

State_Cartographers_Office_Report.pdf: This is a summary report about how to use computer vision techniques, especially object detection method in OpenCV to identify dots in the scanned historical maps. I implemented this project in Python. The dots represent the locations where the camera on the flight took aerial photos from above. 

378 Lab3: How to define functions, read in a csv file, use for loop, and create and populate a dictionary.

378 Lab4: How to create a class and its methods. 

378 Lab5: Use GDAL library to analyze raster image, and calculate NDVI.

378 Lab6: Use OGR library to process shapefiles, and perform vector analysis.

378 Lab7: Use Arcpy library to analyze the spatial relationship between lines, points, and polygons. Use Arcpy to create a slope map based on DEM data.
